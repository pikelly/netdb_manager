NetdbManager
============

This plugin adds DNS and DHCP management to the foreman application whne running as a rails 2.3.5 application

Installation
============

The plugin is provied as a rails engine and therefore requires that the rails engines plugin is installed first.

cd RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins
git clone http://github.com/lazyatom/engines.git engines

Edit the file config/environment.rb and add line 
require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/plugins/engines/boot')

on the line directly below 
require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'boot')

Now we install the netdb_manager plugin itself
git clone git://github.com/pikelly/netdb_manager.git netdb_manager

Now run script/generate plugin_migration netb_manager

and then rake :db:migrate

This implementation used the memcache service so firstly we install the software

yum install memcached

and then use this facility within rails by

adding the line
config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store

to the initializer block in config/environment.rb and then editing config/initializers/session_store.rb
and setting the store type to :mem_cache_store
