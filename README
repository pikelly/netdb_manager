NetsvcManager
============

This plugin adds DNS and DHCP management to the foreman application whne running as a rails 2.3.5 application

Installation
============

The plugin is provied as a rails engine and therefore requires that the rails engines plugin is installed first.

cd RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins
git clone http://github.com/lazyatom/engines.git engines

Edit the file config/environment.rb and add line 
require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/plugins/engines/boot')

on the line directly below 
require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'boot')

Now we install the netsvc_manager plugin itself
git clone git://github.com/pikelly/netdb_manager.git netsvc_manager

Now run script/generate plugin_migration netb_manager

and then rake :db:migrate

This implementation used the memcache service so firstly we install the software

yum install memcached

and then use this facility within rails by

adding the line
config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store

to the initializer block in config/environment.rb and then editing config/initializers/session_store.rb
and setting the store type to :mem_cache_store

At this point you need to create the subnets that your hosts will be installed on. So jump to the subnets page
and create the reuqired entries.

Your hosts now require a subnet and you must run
rake subnets:assign

repeatedly until all your hosts have been assigned a subnet
